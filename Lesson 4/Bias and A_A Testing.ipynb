    "The difference in time of month is significant in determining swim suit advertising responses in users. First those who respond to advertisements in february are probably in locations where the weather permits swim suits as a viable clothing option, or the persons who respond to ads in february could also be enthusiasts who are just \"into\" swim suits,those who do not respond favorably to swim suit advertisements in february could be in a climate that makes swim suits a non viable form of clothing during that month ie cold temperatures. So in short the location and time of year are significant contributing factors to determining the response to swim suit advertisements. The converse is true for the month of may it may be cold in may for some locations and it may also be more interesting for those who did not respond favorably in february."
